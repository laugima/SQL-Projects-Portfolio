Here you will find SQL projects that have been created as part of my Portfolio. 


### [**1. Data Cleaning for Business Insights: Layoffs Analysis**](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%201%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)
In an ever-changing economic landscape, workforce reductions are a critical indicator of business performance, industry trends, and market stability. This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset of company layoffs to ensure accurate and reliable insights for further business analysis.

## **Key Data Cleaning Processes**  
- **ðŸ”¹ Duplicate Removal:** Eliminated redundant records to prevent data inflation and maintain data integrity.  
- **ðŸ”¹ Data Standardization:** Unified industry and company names, standardized dates, and formatted country names to ensure consistency in analysis.  
- **ðŸ”¹ Handling Null or Empty Values:** Addressed missing data in key fields, ensuring completeness for more reliable business insights.  
- **ðŸ”¹ Data Pruning:** Removed irrelevant rows and columns, focusing only on essential business metrics for workforce trend analysis.  

## **Business Impact**  
A clean and structured dataset enables businesses, analysts, and policymakers to:  
âœ… Identify industry-wide layoff trends and their economic implications.  
âœ… Assess how different sectors and company stages (startups vs. established firms) react to market downturns.  
âœ… Provide better workforce planning strategies for companies and HR professionals.  

By refining raw data into actionable insights, this project enhances the accuracy of economic and business decision-making processes. ðŸš€
