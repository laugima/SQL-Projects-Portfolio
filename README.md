# SQL-Projects-Portfolio
Here you will find SQL projects that have been created as part of my Portfolio. 


### [1. Data Cleansing Project:](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%201%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)
**Description:**
This project involves a comprehensive data cleansing process designed to enhance the quality and reliability of contributed datasets. The objective is to prepare the data for analysis by performing several critical tasks:
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to ensure that each entry is unique and accurate.
- **Data Standardization:** Converting data into a consistent format to facilitate easier analysis and comparison.
- **Handling Null or Empty Values:** Addressing missing data through imputation or removal to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
- **Data Pruning:** Removing unnecessary or irrelevant data to streamline the dataset and improve its usability.

The outcome is a refined dataset that is clean, standardized, and ready for further analysis.


### [2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project:](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%202%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql)
**Description:**
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the goal is to analyze and interpret complex datasets to uncover meaningful insights. Key activities include:
- **Data Exploration:** Investigating the dataset through various techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data that could lead to valuable insights.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing hypotheses to draw conclusions that are actionable and relevant to real-world scenarios.
- **Insight Generation:** Providing data-driven recommendations based on the findings to inform decision-making processes.

The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that can be applied in practical situations.


### [3. SQL Data Analysis Project: Restaurant Database:](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%203%20-%20Restaurant%20Database%20Analysis.sql)
**Description:**
This project focuses on SQL-based data analysis to explore and derive insights from a restaurant database. The objective is to analyze menu items, customer orders, and purchasing patterns using SQL queries. Key activities include:
- **Data Exploration:** Investigating menu items and order details to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and contents.
- **Query Development:** Writing SQL queries to extract key metrics such as order counts, sales trends, and customer behavior patterns.
- **Customer Analysis:** Analyzing purchasing habits, most popular items, and high-spending orders to uncover meaningful insights.
- **Insight Generation:** Providing data-driven insights about menu performance and customer preferences for decision-making.

This project demonstrates my SQL skills in data analysis, database management, and insight generation, showcasing my ability to analyze real-world datasets effectively.
