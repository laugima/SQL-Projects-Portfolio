- **Data Standardization:** Unified industry and company names, standardized dates, and formatted country names to ensure consistency in analysis.  
- **Handling Null or Empty Values:** Addressed missing data in key fields, ensuring completeness for more reliable business insights.  
- **Data Pruning:** Removed irrelevant rows and columns, focusing only on essential business metrics for workforce trend analysis.  

### Business Impact
A clean and structured dataset enables businesses, analysts, and policymakers to:  
âœ… Identify industry-wide layoff trends and their economic implications.  
âœ… Assess how different sectors and company stages (startups vs. established firms) react to market downturns.  
âœ… Provide better workforce planning strategies for companies and HR professionals.  

By refining raw data into actionable insights, this project enhances the accuracy of economic and business decision-making processes.

### Business Impact  
A structured EDA provides organizations, analysts, and decision-makers with:  
âœ… Early Warning Signals for potential industry disruptions and economic downturns.  
âœ… Benchmarking Insights to compare workforce stability against competitors.  
âœ… Strategic Workforce Planning for HR teams and executives to optimize hiring and restructuring decisions.  

By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, this analysis helps businesses proactively respond to economic shifts and industry challenges.  


### [3. Data-Driven Decision Making: Restaurant Market Analysis](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%203%20-%20Data-Driven%20Decision%20Making:%20Restaurant%20Market%20Analysis.sql)
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and data-driven insights are essential for optimizing pricing strategies, inventory management, and customer preferences.
