### [**1. Data Cleaning for Business Insights: Layoffs Analysis**](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%201%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20for%20Business%20Insights%3A%20Layoffs%20Analysis.sql)
In an ever-changing economic landscape, workforce reductions are a critical indicator of business performance, industry trends, and market stability. This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset of company layoffs to ensure accurate and reliable insights for further business analysis.

## **Key Data Cleaning Processes**  
- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminated redundant records to prevent data inflation and maintain data integrity.  
- **Data Standardization:** Unified industry and company names, standardized dates, and formatted country names to ensure consistency in analysis.  
- **Handling Null or Empty Values:** Addressed missing data in key fields, ensuring completeness for more reliable business insights.  
- **Data Pruning:** Removed irrelevant rows and columns, focusing only on essential business metrics for workforce trend analysis.  

## **Business Impact**  
A clean and structured dataset enables businesses, analysts, and policymakers to:  
✅ Identify industry-wide layoff trends and their economic implications.  
✅ Assess how different sectors and company stages (startups vs. established firms) react to market downturns.  
✅ Provide better workforce planning strategies for companies and HR professionals.  

By refining raw data into actionable insights, this project enhances the accuracy of economic and business decision-making processes.



### [2. Exploratory Data Analysis for Business Strategy: Layoffs Trends](https://github.com/laugima/SQL-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/PROJECT%202%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql)
In a dynamic economic environment, understanding workforce reductions is crucial for evaluating market stability and business resilience. This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of company layoffs to uncover key trends and insights that businesses and policymakers can leverage for strategic decision-making.  

### Key Analytical Processes
- **Data Exploration:** Assessed distributions, trends, and anomalies in layoffs across industries, company sizes, and time periods.  
- **Industry & Market Segmentation:** Identified sectors most affected by layoffs, helping businesses anticipate risks and adapt strategies.  
- **Temporal Analysis:** Analyzed layoffs over time to detect economic downturns, seasonal workforce adjustments, and recession impacts.  
- **Cross-Sector Comparisons:** Compared startup layoffs vs. corporate downsizing to assess resilience across different business models.  

### Business Impact  
A structured EDA provides organizations, analysts, and decision-makers with:  
✅ Early Warning Signals for potential industry disruptions and economic downturns.  
✅ Benchmarking Insights to compare workforce stability against competitors.  
✅ Strategic Workforce Planning for HR teams and executives to optimize hiring and restructuring decisions.  

By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, this analysis helps businesses proactively respond to economic shifts and industry challenges.
